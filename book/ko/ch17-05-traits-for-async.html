<p>Throughout the chapter, we’ve used the <code>Future</code>, <code>Pin</code>, <code>Unpin</code>, <code>Stream</code>, and <code>StreamExt</code> traits in various ways. So far, though, we’ve avoided getting too far into the details of how they work or how they fit together, which is fine most of the time for your day-to-day Rust work. Sometimes, though, you’ll encounter situations where you’ll need to understand a few more of these details. In this section, we’ll dig in just enough to help in those scenarios, still leaving the <em>really</em> deep dive for other documentation.</p>
<!-- Old headings. Do not remove or links may break. -->
<p><a id="future"></a></p>
<h3 id="the-future-trait"><a class="header" href="#the-future-trait">The <code>Future</code> Trait</a></h3>
<p>Let’s start by taking a closer look at how the <code>Future</code> trait works. Here’s how Rust defines it:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust edition2021"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>use std::pin::Pin;
use std::task::{Context, Poll};

pub trait Future {
    type Output;

    fn poll(self: Pin&lt;&amp;mut Self&gt;, cx: &amp;mut Context&lt;'_&gt;) -&gt; Poll&lt;Self::Output&gt;;
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>That trait definition includes a bunch of new types and also some syntax we haven’t seen before, so let’s walk through the definition piece by piece.</p>
<p>First, <code>Future</code>’s associated type <code>Output</code> says what the future resolves to. This is analogous to the <code>Item</code> associated type for the <code>Iterator</code> trait. Second, <code>Future</code> also has the <code>poll</code> method, which takes a special <code>Pin</code> reference for its <code>self</code> parameter and a mutable reference to a <code>Context</code> type, and returns a <code>Poll&lt;Self::Output&gt;</code>. We’ll talk more about <code>Pin</code> and <code>Context</code> in a moment. For now, let’s focus on what the method returns, the <code>Poll</code> type:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust edition2021"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>enum Poll&lt;T&gt; {
    Ready(T),
    Pending,
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This <code>Poll</code> type is similar to an <code>Option</code>. It has one variant that has a value, <code>Ready(T)</code>, and one which does not, <code>Pending</code>. <code>Poll</code> means something quite different from <code>Option</code>, though! The <code>Pending</code> variant indicates that the future still has work to do, so the caller will need to check again later. The <code>Ready</code> variant indicates that the future has finished its work and the <code>T</code> value is available.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: With most futures, the caller should not call <code>poll</code> again after the future has returned <code>Ready</code>. Many futures will panic if polled again after becoming ready. Futures that are safe to poll again will say so explicitly in their documentation. This is similar to how <code>Iterator::next</code> behaves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you see code that uses <code>await</code>, Rust compiles it under the hood to code that calls <code>poll</code>. If you look back at Listing 17-4, where we printed out the page title for a single URL once it resolved, Rust compiles it into something kind of (although not exactly) like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">match page_title(url).poll() {
    Ready(page_title) =&gt; match page_title {
        Some(title) =&gt; println!("The title for {url} was {title}"),
        None =&gt; println!("{url} had no title"),
    }
    Pending =&gt; {
        // But what goes here?
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>What should we do when the future is still <code>Pending</code>? We need some way to try again, and again, and again, until the future is finally ready. In other words, we need a loop:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let mut page_title_fut = page_title(url);
loop {
    match page_title_fut.poll() {
        Ready(value) =&gt; match page_title {
            Some(title) =&gt; println!("The title for {url} was {title}"),
            None =&gt; println!("{url} had no title"),
        }
        Pending =&gt; {
            // continue
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>If Rust compiled it to exactly that code, though, every <code>await</code> would be blocking—exactly the opposite of what we were going for! Instead, Rust makes sure that the loop can hand off control to something that can pause work on this future to work on other futures and then check this one again later. As we’ve seen, that something is an async runtime, and this scheduling and coordination work is one of its main jobs.</p>
<p>Earlier in the chapter, we described waiting on <code>rx.recv</code>. The <code>recv</code> call returns a future, and awaiting the future polls it. We noted that a runtime will pause the future until it’s ready with either <code>Some(message)</code> or <code>None</code> when the channel closes. With our deeper understanding of the <code>Future</code> trait, and specifically <code>Future::poll</code>, we can see how that works. The runtime knows the future isn’t ready when it returns <code>Poll::Pending</code>. Conversely, the runtime knows the future <em>is</em> ready and advances it when <code>poll</code> returns <code>Poll::Ready(Some(message))</code> or <code>Poll::Ready(None)</code>.</p>
<p>The exact details of how a runtime does that are beyond the scope of this book, but the key is to see the basic mechanics of futures: a runtime <em>polls</em> each future it is responsible for, putting the future back to sleep when it is not yet ready.</p>

<h3 id="the-pin-and-unpin-traits"><a class="header" href="#the-pin-and-unpin-traits">The <code>Pin</code> and <code>Unpin</code> Traits</a></h3>
<p>When we introduced the idea of pinning in Listing 17-16, we ran into a very gnarly error message. Here is the relevant part of it again:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>This error message tells us not only that we need to pin the values but also why pinning is required. The <code>trpl::join_all</code> function returns a struct called <code>JoinAll</code>. That struct is generic over a type <code>F</code>, which is constrained to implement the <code>Future</code> trait. Directly awaiting a future with <code>await</code> pins the future implicitly. That’s why we don’t need to use <code>pin!</code> everywhere we want to await futures.</p>
<p>However, we’re not directly awaiting a future here. Instead, we construct a new future, <code>JoinAll</code>, by passing a collection of futures to the <code>join_all</code> function. The signature for <code>join_all</code> requires that the types of the items in the collection all implement the <code>Future</code> trait, and <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> implements <code>Future</code> only if the <code>T</code> it wraps is a future that implements the <code>Unpin</code> trait.</p>
<p>That’s a lot to absorb! To really understand it, let’s dive a little further into how the <code>Future</code> trait actually works, in particular around <em>pinning</em>.</p>
<p>Look again at the definition of the <code>Future</code> trait:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust edition2021"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>use std::pin::Pin;
use std::task::{Context, Poll};

pub trait Future {
    type Output;

    // Required method
    fn poll(self: Pin&lt;&amp;mut Self&gt;, cx: &amp;mut Context&lt;'_&gt;) -&gt; Poll&lt;Self::Output&gt;;
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The <code>cx</code> parameter and its <code>Context</code> type are the key to how a runtime actually knows when to check any given future while still being lazy. Again, the details of how that works are beyond the scope of this chapter, and you generally only need to think about this when writing a custom <code>Future</code> implementation. We’ll focus instead on the type for <code>self</code>, as this is the first time we’ve seen a method where <code>self</code> has a type annotation. A type annotation for <code>self</code> works like type annotations for other function parameters, but with two key differences:</p>

<p>We’ll see more on this syntax in <a href="ch18-00-oop.html">Chapter 18</a><!-- ignore -->. For now, it’s enough to know that if we want to poll a future to check whether it is <code>Pending</code> or <code>Ready(Output)</code>, we need a <code>Pin</code>-wrapped mutable reference to the type.</p>
<p><code>Pin</code> is a wrapper for pointer-like types such as <code>&amp;</code>, <code>&amp;mut</code>, <code>Box</code>, and <code>Rc</code>. (Technically, <code>Pin</code> works with types that implement the <code>Deref</code> or <code>DerefMut</code> traits, but this is effectively equivalent to working only with pointers.) <code>Pin</code> is not a pointer itself and doesn’t have any behavior of its own like <code>Rc</code> and <code>Arc</code> do with reference counting; it’s purely a tool the compiler can use to enforce constraints on pointer usage.</p>
<p>Recalling that <code>await</code> is implemented in terms of calls to <code>poll</code> starts to explain the error message we saw earlier, but that was in terms of <code>Unpin</code>, not <code>Pin</code>. So how exactly does <code>Pin</code> relate to <code>Unpin</code>, and why does <code>Future</code> need <code>self</code> to be in a <code>Pin</code> type to call <code>poll</code>?</p>
<p>Remember from earlier in this chapter a series of await points in a future get compiled into a state machine, and the compiler makes sure that state machine follows all of Rust’s normal rules around safety, including borrowing and ownership. To make that work, Rust looks at what data is needed between one await point and either the next await point or the end of the async block. It then creates a corresponding variant in the compiled state machine. Each variant gets the access it needs to the data that will be used in that section of the source code, whether by taking ownership of that data or by getting a mutable or immutable reference to it.</p>
<p>So far, so good: if we get anything wrong about the ownership or references in a given async block, the borrow checker will tell us. When we want to move around the future that corresponds to that block—like moving it into a <code>Vec</code> to pass to <code>join_all</code>—things get trickier.</p>
<p>When we move a future—whether by pushing it into a data structure to use as an iterator with <code>join_all</code> or by returning it from a function—that actually means moving the state machine Rust creates for us. And unlike most other types in Rust, the futures Rust creates for async blocks can end up with references to themselves in the fields of any given variant, as shown in the simplified illustration in Figure 17-4.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="A single-column, three-row table representing a future, fut1, which has data values 0 and 1 in the first two rows and an arrow pointing from the third row back to the second row, representing an internal reference within the future." src="img/trpl17-04.svg" class="center" />
<figcaption>Figure 17-4: A self-referential data type.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>By default, though, any object that has a reference to itself is unsafe to move, because references always point to the actual memory address of whatever they refer to (see Figure 17-5). If you move the data structure itself, those internal references will be left pointing to the old location. However, that memory location is now invalid. For one thing, its value will not be updated when you make changes to the data structure. For another—more important—thing, the computer is now free to reuse that memory for other purposes! You could end up reading completely unrelated data later.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Two tables, depicting two futures, fut1 and fut2, each of which has one column and three rows, representing the result of having moved a future out of fut1 into fut2. The first, fut1, is grayed out, with a question mark in each index, representing unknown memory. The second, fut2, has 0 and 1 in the first and second rows and an arrow pointing from its third row back to the second row of fut1, representing a pointer that is referencing the old location in memory of the future before it was moved." src="img/trpl17-05.svg" class="center" />
<figcaption>Figure 17-5: The unsafe result of moving a self-referential data type</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Theoretically, the Rust compiler could try to update every reference to an object whenever it gets moved, but that could add a lot of performance overhead, especially if a whole web of references needs updating. If we could instead make sure the data structure in question <em>doesn’t move in memory</em>, we wouldn’t have to update any references. This is exactly what Rust’s borrow checker requires: in safe code, it prevents you from moving any item with an active reference to it.</p>
<p><code>Pin</code> builds on that to give us the exact guarantee we need. When we <em>pin</em> a value by wrapping a pointer to that value in <code>Pin</code>, it can no longer move. Thus, if you have <code>Pin&lt;Box&lt;SomeType&gt;&gt;</code>, you actually pin the <code>SomeType</code> value, <em>not</em> the <code>Box</code> pointer. Figure 17-6 illustrates this process.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Three boxes laid out side by side. The first is labeled “Pin”, the second “b1”, and the third “pinned”. Within “pinned” is a table labeled “fut”, with a single column; it represents a future with cells for each part of the data structure. Its first cell has the value “0”, its second cell has an arrow coming out of it and pointing to the fourth and final cell, which has the value “1” in it, and the third cell has dashed lines and an ellipsis to indicate there may be other parts to the data structure. All together, the “fut” table represents a future which is self-referential. An arrow leaves the box labeled “Pin”, goes through the box labeled “b1” and has terminates inside the “pinned” box at the “fut” table." src="img/trpl17-06.svg" class="center" />
<figcaption>Figure 17-6: Pinning a `Box` that points to a self-referential future type.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In fact, the <code>Box</code> pointer can still move around freely. Remember: we care about making sure the data ultimately being referenced stays in place. If a pointer moves around, <em>but the data it points to is in the same place</em>, as in Figure 17-7, there’s no potential problem. As an independent exercise, look at the docs for the types as well as the <code>std::pin</code> module and try to work out how you’d do this with a <code>Pin</code> wrapping a <code>Box</code>.) The key is that the self-referential type itself cannot move, because it is still pinned.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Four boxes laid out in three rough columns, identical to the previous diagram with a change to the second column. Now there are two boxes in the second column, labeled “b1” and “b2”, “b1” is grayed out, and the arrow from “Pin” goes through “b2” instead of “b1”, indicating that the pointer has moved from “b1” to “b2”, but the data in “pinned” has not moved." src="img/trpl17-07.svg" class="center" />
<figcaption>Figure 17-7: Moving a `Box` which points to a self-referential future type.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>However, most types are perfectly safe to move around, even if they happen to be behind a <code>Pin</code> pointer. We only need to think about pinning when items have internal references. Primitive values such as numbers and Booleans are safe since they obviously don’t have any internal references, so they’re obviously safe. Neither do most types you normally work with in Rust. You can move around a <code>Vec</code>, for example, without worrying. Given only what we have seen so far, if you have a <code>Pin&lt;Vec&lt;String&gt;&gt;</code>, you’d have to do everything via the safe but restrictive APIs provided by <code>Pin</code>, even though a <code>Vec&lt;String&gt;</code> is always safe to move if there are no other references to it. We need a way to tell the compiler that it’s fine to move items around in cases like this—and there’s where <code>Unpin</code> comes into play.</p>
<p><code>Unpin</code> is a marker trait, similar to the <code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code> traits we saw in Chapter 16, and thus has no functionality of its own. Marker traits exist only to tell the compiler it’s safe to use the type implementing a given trait in a particular context. <code>Unpin</code> informs the compiler that a given type does <em>not</em> need to uphold any guarantees about whether the value in question can be safely moved.</p>
<!--
  The inline `<code>` in the next block is to allow the inline `<em>` inside it,
  matching what NoStarch does style-wise, and emphasizing within the text here
  that it is something distinct from a normal type.
-->
<p>Just as with <code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code>, the compiler implements <code>Unpin</code> automatically for all types where it can prove it is safe. A special case, again similar to <code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code>, is where <code>Unpin</code> is <em>not</em> implemented for a type. The notation for this is <code>impl !Unpin for <em>SomeType</em></code>, where <code><em>SomeType</em></code> is the name of a type that <em>does</em> need to uphold those guarantees to be safe whenever a pointer to that type is used in a <code>Pin</code>.</p>
<p>In other words, there are two things to keep in mind about the relationship between <code>Pin</code> and <code>Unpin</code>. First, <code>Unpin</code> is the “normal” case, and <code>!Unpin</code> is the special case. Second, whether a type implements <code>Unpin</code> or <code>!Unpin</code> <em>only</em> matters when you’re using a pinned pointer to that type like <code>Pin&lt;&amp;mut <em>SomeType</em>&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>To make that concrete, think about a <code>String</code>: it has a length and the Unicode characters that make it up. We can wrap a <code>String</code> in <code>Pin</code>, as seen in Figure 17-8. However, <code>String</code> automatically implements <code>Unpin</code>, as do most other types in Rust.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Concurrent work flow" src="img/trpl17-08.svg" class="center" />
<figcaption>Figure 17-8: Pinning a `String`; the dotted line indicates that the `String` implements the `Unpin` trait, and thus is not pinned.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As a result, we can do things that would be illegal if <code>String</code> implemented <code>!Unpin</code> instead, such as replacing one string with another at the exact same location in memory as in Figure 17-9. This doesn’t violate the <code>Pin</code> contract, because <code>String</code> has no internal references that make it unsafe to move around! That is precisely why it implements <code>Unpin</code> rather than <code>!Unpin</code>.</p>

</figure>
<p>Now we know enough to understand the errors reported for that <code>join_all</code> call from back in Listing 17-17. We originally tried to move the futures produced by async blocks into a <code>Vec&lt;Box&lt;dyn Future&lt;Output = ()&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>, but as we’ve seen, those futures may have internal references, so they don’t implement <code>Unpin</code>. They need to be pinned, and then we can pass the <code>Pin</code> type into the <code>Vec</code>, confident that the underlying data in the futures will <em>not</em> be moved.</p>
<p><code>Pin</code> and <code>Unpin</code> are mostly important for building lower-level libraries, or when you’re building a runtime itself, rather than for day-to-day Rust code. When you see these traits in error messages, though, now you’ll have a better idea of how to fix your code!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: This combination of <code>Pin</code> and <code>Unpin</code> makes it possible to safely implement a whole class of complex types in Rust that would otherwise prove challenging because they’re self-referential. Types that require <code>Pin</code> show up most commonly in async Rust today, but every once in a while, you might see them in other contexts, too.</p>
<p>The specifics of how <code>Pin</code> and <code>Unpin</code> work, and the rules they’re required to uphold, are covered extensively in the API documentation for <code>std::pin</code>, so if you’re interested in learning more, that’s a great place to start.</p>

<h3 id="the-stream-trait"><a class="header" href="#the-stream-trait">The <code>Stream</code> Trait</a></h3>
<p>Now that you have a deeper grasp on the <code>Future</code>, <code>Pin</code>, and <code>Unpin</code> traits, we can turn our attention to the <code>Stream</code> trait. As you learned earlier in the chapter, streams are similar to asynchronous iterators. Unlike <code>Iterator</code> and <code>Future</code>, however, <code>Stream</code> has no definition in the standard library as of this writing, but there <em>is</em> a very common definition from the <code>futures</code> crate used throughout the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Let’s review the definitions of the <code>Iterator</code> and <code>Future</code> traits before looking at how a <code>Stream</code> trait might merge them together. From <code>Iterator</code>, we have the idea of a sequence: its <code>next</code> method provides an <code>Option&lt;Self::Item&gt;</code>. From <code>Future</code>, we have the idea of readiness over time: its <code>poll</code> method provides a <code>Poll&lt;Self::Output&gt;</code>. To represent a sequence of items that become ready over time, we define a <code>Stream</code> trait that puts those features together:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust edition2021"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>use std::pin::Pin;
use std::task::{Context, Poll};

trait Stream {
    type Item;

    fn poll_next(
        self: Pin&lt;&amp;mut Self&gt;,
        cx: &amp;mut Context&lt;'_&gt;
    ) -&gt; Poll&lt;Option&lt;Self::Item&gt;&gt;;
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The <code>Stream</code> trait defines an associated type called <code>Item</code> for the type of the items produced by the stream. This is similar to <code>Iterator</code>, where there may be zero to many items, and unlike <code>Future</code>, where there is always a single <code>Output</code>, even if it’s the unit type <code>()</code>.</p>
<p><code>Stream</code> also defines a method to get those items. We call it <code>poll_next</code>, to make it clear that it polls in the same way <code>Future::poll</code> does and produces a sequence of items in the same way <code>Iterator::next</code> does. Its return type combines <code>Poll</code> with <code>Option</code>. The outer type is <code>Poll</code>, because it has to be checked for readiness, just as a future does. The inner type is <code>Option</code>, because it needs to signal whether there are more messages, just as an iterator does.</p>
<p>Something very similar to this definition will likely end up as part of Rust’s standard library. In the meantime, it’s part of the toolkit of most runtimes, so you can rely on it, and everything we cover next should generally apply!</p>
<p>In the example we saw in the section on streaming, though, we didn’t use <code>poll_next</code> <em>or</em> <code>Stream</code>, but instead used <code>next</code> and <code>StreamExt</code>. We <em>could</em> work directly in terms of the <code>poll_next</code> API by hand-writing our own <code>Stream</code> state machines, of course, just as we <em>could</em> work with futures directly via their <code>poll</code> method. Using <code>await</code> is much nicer, though, and the <code>StreamExt</code> trait supplies the <code>next</code> method so we can do just that:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust edition2021"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">use std::pin::Pin;
</span><span class="boring">use std::task::{Context, Poll};
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">trait Stream {
</span><span class="boring">    type Item;
</span><span class="boring">    fn poll_next(
</span><span class="boring">        self: Pin&lt;&amp;mut Self&gt;,
</span><span class="boring">        cx: &amp;mut Context&lt;'_&gt;,
</span><span class="boring">    ) -&gt; Poll&lt;Option&lt;Self::Item&gt;&gt;;
</span><span class="boring">}
</span><span class="boring">
</span>trait StreamExt: Stream {
    async fn next(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Option&lt;Self::Item&gt;
    where
        Self: Unpin;

    // other methods...
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<!--
TODO: update this if/when tokio/etc. update their MSRV and switch to using async functions
in traits, since the lack thereof is the reason they do not yet have this.
-->
<blockquote>
<p>Note: The actual definition we used earlier in the chapter looks slightly different than this, because it supports versions of Rust that did not yet support using async functions in traits. As a result, it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn next(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Next&lt;'_, Self&gt; where Self: Unpin;</code></pre>
<p>That <code>Next</code> type is a <code>struct</code> that implements <code>Future</code> and allows us to name the lifetime of the reference to <code>self</code> with <code>Next&lt;'_, Self&gt;</code>, so that <code>await</code> can work with this method.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>StreamExt</code> trait is also the home of all the interesting methods available to use with streams. <code>StreamExt</code> is automatically implemented for every type that implements <code>Stream</code>, but these traits are defined separately to enable the community to iterate on convenience APIs without affecting the foundational trait.</p>
<p>In the version of <code>StreamExt</code> used in the <code>trpl</code> crate, the trait not only defines the <code>next</code> method but also supplies a default implementation of <code>next</code> that correctly handles the details of calling <code>Stream::poll_next</code>. This means that even when you need to write your own streaming data type, you <em>only</em> have to implement <code>Stream</code>, and then anyone who uses your data type can use <code>StreamExt</code> and its methods with it automatically.</p>
<p>That’s all we’re going to cover for the lower-level details on these traits. To wrap up, let’s consider how futures (including streams), tasks, and threads all fit together!</p>

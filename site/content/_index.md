title: Rust Translations
---

This is an **unofficial** document translation project for [Rust Programming Language](https://rust-lang.org).
The following advantages are provided by this project:

## All documentation
All documentation hosted under https://doc.rust-lang.org is supported, so users can easily find translated documentation. Other documentation can also be added.

## Always up to date
In conventional translations, the content becomes outdated as the original is updated. With this site, the content is always up to date, but untranslated parts are displayed in English. Users who notice the English display can contribute to the translation.

## Language selector
All documentation has a language selector, so users can easily refer to the original English version.

## Translator-friendly workflow
We provide the workflow necessary for translators, such as automatic updates of the original version and measurement of translation rate (planned). Unlike when each translator works in their own repository, workflow improvements reach all translators.

If you are interesting in document translation, please see [the project on GitHub](https://github.com/rust-lang-translations/project).

# Usage

All the documents have a language selector at the top right of the pages.

# Documents

* [The Rust Programming Language](https://rust-lang-translations.org/book)
* [The Rust Edition Guide](https://rust-lang-translations.org/edition-guide)
* [The Embedded Rust Book](https://rust-lang-translations.org/embedded-book)
* [The Rustonomicon](https://rust-lang-translations.org/nomicon)
* [The Rust Reference](https://rust-lang-translations.org/reference)
* [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example) : The official site

If you want to add other documents, please open a [issue](https://github.com/rust-lang-translations/project/issues).

The official [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example) already has some translations, so this project doesn't include it.
